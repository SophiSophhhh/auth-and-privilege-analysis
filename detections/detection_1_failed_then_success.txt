Detection Name:
Multiple Failed SSH Logins Followed by Successful Authentication

Description:
This detection identifies SSH authentication activity where multiple failed login attempts are followed by a successful login from the same source IP. This pattern may indicate 
credential guessing or brute force activity potential account compromise.

Detection Logic:
- ≥ 5 failed SSH authentication attempts
- From the same source IP address
- Targeting the same user account
- Followed by 1 successful SSH login
- Occurring within a 10-minute time window

Potential False Positives:
- User mistyping credentials multiple times before successfully logging in
- Automated configuration or deployment tools retrying authentication
- Known bastion hosts or jump servers with repeated login attempts
- Scripts or monitoring tools using outdated credentials

What Happened:
An SSH authentication event was observed where multiple failed login attempts from a single source IP were followed by a successful login to the same account.

Additional Context to Review:
- Is the source IP previously associated with the user?
- Is the source IP from a known geographic location for the user?
- Is the login occurring outside normal working hours?
- Has the account shown similar behavior in the past?

Risk Level:
Medium – multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login indicate potential credential misuse, but no privilege escalation or lateral movement has occurred yet.

Why SOC Cares:
Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful authentication from the same source IP may indicate credential misuse. This behavior increases the risk of account compromise and warrants further investigation to prevent privilege escalation or lateral movement.

Recommended Actions:
- Validate whether the source IP and login activity are expected for the user.
- Monitor post-login activity for indicators of privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence.
- Correlate authentication logs to identify abnormal login patterns or repeated access attempts.
