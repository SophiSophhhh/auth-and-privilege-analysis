Detection Name:
Multiple Failed SSH Logins Followed by Successful Authentication

Description:
This detection identifies SSH authentication activity where multiple failed login attempts are followed by a successful login from the same source IP. This pattern may indicate 
credential guessing or brute force activity resulting in account compromise.

Detection Logic:
- Multiple failed SSH authentication attempts from a single source IP
- A subsequent successful SSH login from the same source IP within a short time window

What Happened:
An SSH authentication event was observed where multiple failed login attempts from a single source IP were followed by a successful login to the same account.

Risk Level:
Medium – multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login indicate potential credential misuse, but no privilege escalation or lateral movement has occurred yet.

Why SOC Cares:
Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful authentication from the same source IP may indicate credential misuse. This behavior increases the risk of account compromise and warrants further investigation to prevent privilege escalation or lateral movement.

Recommended Action:
- Validate whether the source IP and login activity are expected for the user.
- Monitor post-login activity for indicators of privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence.
- Correlate authentication logs to identify abnormal login patterns or repeated access attempts.
