Detection Name:
Multiple Source IPs Attempting Authentication Against a Single User Account

Description:
This detection identifies multiple authentication attempts against a single user account originating from different source IP addresses followed by success, which may indicate abnormal access patterns requiring further investigation.

Detection Logic:
- ≥ 5 failed SSH authentication attempts
- Originating from multiple distinct source IP addresses
- Targeting the same user account
- Followed by a successful SSH authentication to the same account from one of the previously observed source IPs
- All activity occurring within a 10-minute time window

Potential False Positives:
- Automated scripts or services using a shared account across multiple hosts.
- Users connecting via rotating VPN endpoints or NAT devices, causing multiple IPs to appear.
- Shared service accounts legitimately accessed by multiple users or systems.
- Recent password rotations causing failed login attempts from multiple IPs.

What Happened:
Multiple SSH authentication attempts were observed from different source IPs targeting the same user account, with one successful login from a previously failing IP. This pattern triggered the alert due to unusual access behavior and meets the defined detection criteria.

Risk Level:
Medium – multiple authentication attempts from different source IPs targeting a single account may indicate credential abuse; however, no successful authentication or privilege escalation has been observed.

Why SOC Cares:
This behavior may indicate coordinated credential abuse attempts against a single account, increasing the risk of unauthorized access if successful. Detecting this pattern early allows SOC teams to investigate, validate IP legitimacy, and prevent potential account compromise or lateral movement.

Additional Context to Review
- Are the source IPs internal, external, or VPN-assigned?
- Are the IPs associated with known infrastructure or automation?
- Is the account a shared or service account?
- Does this user normally authenticate from multiple locations?

Recommended Actions:
- Validate whether the source IP addresses are known and expected for the user account.
- Correlate authentication logs to identify abnormal login patterns or repeated access attempts from multiple source IPs.
- Monitor for any successful authentication events and subsequent post-login activity, including privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
