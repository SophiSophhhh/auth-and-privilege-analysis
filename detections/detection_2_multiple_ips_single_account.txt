Detection Name:
Multiple Source IPs Attempting Authentication Against a Single User Account

Description:
This detection identifies multiple authentication attempts against a single user account originating from different source IP addresses, which may indicate abnormal access patterns requiring further investigation.

Detection Logic:
- ≥ 5 failed SSH authentication attempts
- Originating from different source IP addresses
- Targeting the same user account
- Occurring within a defined time window

Potential False Positives:
- Automated scripts or services using a shared account across multiple hosts.
- Users connecting from multiple VPN endpoints or NAT devices, causing multiple IPs to appear.
- Shared service accounts legitimately accessed by multiple users or systems.
- Recent password rotations causing failed login attempts from multiple IPs.

What Happened:
Multiple SSH authentication attempts were observed from different source IPs targeting the same user account, triggering the alert due to unusual access patterns.

Risk Level:
Medium – multiple authentication attempts from different source IPs targeting a single account may indicate credential abuse; however, no successful authentication or privilege escalation has been observed.

Why SOC Cares:
This behavior aligns with password spraying or coordinated credential abuse techniques. If successful, it could result in unauthorized access to a valid account and enable further activity such as lateral movement or persistence, particularly if the account has elevated privileges.

Additional Context to Review
- Are the source IPs internal, external, or VPN-assigned?
- Are the IPs associated with known infrastructure or automation?
- Is the account a shared or service account?
- Does this user normally authenticate from multiple locations?

Recommended Actions:
- Validate whether the source IP addresses are known and expected for the user account.
- Correlate authentication logs to identify abnormal login patterns or repeated access attempts from multiple source IPs.
- Monitor for any successful authentication events and subsequent post-login activity, including privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
