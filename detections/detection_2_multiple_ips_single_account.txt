Detection Name:
Multiple Source IPs Attempting Authentication Against a Single User Account

Description:
This detection identifies multiple authentication attempts against a single user account originating from different source IP addresses, which may indicate abnormal access patterns requiring further investigation.

Detection Logic:
- ≥ 5 failed SSH authentication attempts
- Originating from different source IP addresses
- Targeting the same user account
- Occurring within a defined time window

Potential False Positives:
- Automated scripts or services using a shared account across multiple hosts.
- Users connecting from multiple VPN endpoints or NAT devices, causing multiple IPs to appear.
- Shared service accounts legitimately accessed by multiple users or systems.
- Recent password rotations causing failed login attempts from multiple IPs.

What Happened:
Multiple SSH authentication attempts were observed from different source IPs targeting the same user account, triggering the alert due to unusual access patterns.
