Detection Name: Privilege Escalation via Sudo

Detection Concept:
Successful sudo usage by a non-admin user shortly after authentication

What Happened:
A successful SSH login to a non-root user account was followed by sudo command execution within a short time window.

Detection Logic:
- Successful SSH login
- Followed by sudo command execution
- By a non-admin user
- Within a short time window (e.g. 5–10 minutes)

False Positives:

Risk Level:
High – Sudo activity occurring immediately after authentication significantly increases risk, as it suggests the primary purpose of the login was to execute privileged commands. This behavior is consistent with post-compromise privilege escalation and reduces the window for detection.
